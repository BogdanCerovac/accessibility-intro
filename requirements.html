<h1>Requirements Analysis for Introduction to Web Accessibility</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Primary purpose: a short introduction to Web accessibility for newbies</li>
  <li>Secondary purpose: link to resources that provide more information on the topics covered</li>
</ul>
<p>Not: Introducing people to <strong>all</strong> the WAI resources is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a purpose of this document.</p>
<h2>Audience</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Primary audience is people who are new to Web accessibility, including all user roles: developers, designers, evaluators/testers, content creators, web administrators, project managers, advocates, 
    policy makers, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other audience notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People translating the document and people reading it in another language </li>
  <li>People using this information in presentations, articles, etc. and people receiving the presentation, article, etc. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Current Documents and Approach</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a> is a very old page on the WAI sub-site</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">Accessibility - W3C</a> is a more recent page developed for the W3C main site</li>
</ul>
<p>We originally planned to update <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">Accessibility - W3C</a> and use that same content to replace <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility">Introduction to Web Accessibility</a>. However, based on Reviewe Team feedback, we now plan to keep the WAi page, and revise it to be updated and tersified. Issues specific to this point include <a href="https://github.com/w3c/accessibility-intro/issues/3">[W3C WAI] same content for W3C main site and WAI sub-site? #3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/accessibility-intro/issues/4">[WAI] existing WAI content #4</a>.
